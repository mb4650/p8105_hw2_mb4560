## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read and clean 2017 and 2018 precipitation data.

``` r
precip_2018 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1,
    ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1,
    ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation.

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017) 

precip_final = 
  left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

``` r
#Calculate median sports balls for 2017 to include in inline code
trashwheel_2017 = 
  subset(trashwheel_df, year == 2017) 
  
sportsballs_2017 =
  median(pull(trashwheel_2017, sports_balls))
```

This dataset includes data collected by Mr. Trash Wheel, a water-wheel
trash collector, in Baltimore, Maryland. Mr. Trash Wheel collects trash
that flows into the inner harbor and then stores that trash in a
dumpster, which is later taken to waste-to-energy plants and incinerated
to create electricity. The dataset itself includes information on the
date, dumpster number, as well as the amount and type of trash. There
are 344 observations in our final dataset. We also saw a median number
of 8 sports balls in a dumpster in 2017. Other sheets include
information on the precipitation levels in inches by month. In the
combined 2017 and 2018 precipitation dataframe, there are 24
observations, with a total precipitation level of 70.33 inches in 2018
and 32.93 inches in 2017.
